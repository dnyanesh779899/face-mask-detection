Face Mask Detection ðŸ˜·

A computer vision project that uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect if a person is wearing a face mask.
The model is trained on images of people with masks and without masks.

Features

CNN-based binary image classification (mask / no mask)

Face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascades

Data augmentation for robust training

Applications in public safety monitoring (airports, hospitals, offices, malls)

Tech Stack

Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
