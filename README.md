Face Mask Detection ðŸ˜·

A computer vision project that uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect if a person is wearing a face mask.
The model is trained on images of people with masks and without masks, and deployed in real-time using a webcam feed.

Features:

CNN-based binary image classification (mask / no mask)

Real-time face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascades

Data augmentation for robust training

Potential application in public safety monitoring (airports, hospitals, offices, malls)

Tech Stack:

Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPyFace Mask Detection ðŸ˜·
